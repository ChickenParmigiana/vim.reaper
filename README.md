# Installation

Currently you can simply copy `init.vim` into your neovim config directory. However I am planning to break up the main config file into more modular, manageable parts. Stay tuned.

# Usage

## Startify
To open Neovim to the startify buffer, simply launch `nvim` without any arguments. Your recently edited files will be displayed, as well as recently edited files from the current directory.
